# Train-Scheduler App

CHOO CHOO!!! Time to get onboard this [Train Scheduler App](https://houstonc11.github.io/Train-Scheduler/) and start better managing your logistics. This app utilizes Google Firebase as a server to host train schedules and uses modern.js to give per minute updates of arrival times.

* Technology

  * HTML5
  * Bootstrap
  * Javascript
  * JQUERY
  * Firebase
  * Modern.js
  
* Functionality:

  1) Start the app and you can view already scheduled trains that have departed.
  2) Use the form at the bottom to add a train and the app will automatically calculate when the the train will arrive and how many hours and minutes until that scheduled arrival using modern.js. The front end is displayed using HTML5, bootstrap, javascript, and jquery.
  3) When a train is added, that train's information will be saved to Google Firebase. That train's information will then be accessible to all users of the app.
